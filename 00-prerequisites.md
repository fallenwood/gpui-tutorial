# Prerequisites

## Rust

For this tutorial to be useful, you should know basic rust. Here are some resources:

* [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) through chapter 15
* [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) through chapter 16
* [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) through section 19

Either the book or the example will be fine; use rustlings to get some hands-on experience.

## Installation

Since gpui is a part of Zed's codebase, we can borrow their setup instructions to get set up to do gpui development. Follow the instructions in the `Dependencies` section for [macOS](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/macos.md#dependencies), [Linux](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/linux.md#dependencies), or [Windows](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/windows.md#dependencies). You'll ignore the other sections, but there might be troubleshooting at the bottom that will be helpful.
